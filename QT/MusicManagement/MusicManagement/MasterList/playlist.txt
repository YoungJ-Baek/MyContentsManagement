Ayy ayy ayy ayy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ayy ayy
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Needless to say I keep her in check
She was all bad bad nevertheless
Callin' it quits now baby I'm a wreck
Crash at my place baby you're a wreck
Needless to say I'm keeping her checked
She was all bad bad nevertheless
Callin' it quits now baby I'm a wreck
Crash at my place baby you're a wreck
Thinkin' in a bad way losin' your grip
Screamin' at my face baby don't trip
Someone took a big L
Don't know how that felt
Lookin' at you sideways party on tilt
Ooh ooh some things you
Just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise
And I'm not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower
Every time I'm leavin' on ya
You don't make it easy no
Wish I could be there for ya
Give me a reason to oh
Every time I'm walkin' out
I can hear you tellin' me to turn around
Fightin' for my trust
And you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now oh
I know you're scared of the unknown
You don't wanna be alone
I know I always come and go
But it's out of my control
And you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust
Unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower
You're the sunflower^

I love it when you call me senorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true la la la
Ooh I should be runnin'
Ooh you keep me coming for ya
Land in miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name la la la
It felt like ooh la la la yeah no
Sapphire and moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands la la la
It felt like ooh la la la yeah
I love it when you call me senorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true la la la
Ooh I should be runnin'
Ooh you know I love it
When you call me senorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true la la la
Ooh I should be runnin'
Ooh you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things
That never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way
You taste la la la
'Cause you know
It's been a long time coming
Don't ya let me fall oh
Ooh when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love your kiss is deadly don't stop
I love it when you call me senorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true la la la
Ooh I should be runnin'
Ooh you know I love it
When you call me senorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true la la la
Ooh I should be runnin'
Ooh you keep me coming for ya
All along I've been coming for ya (For you)
And I hope it means something to you
Call my name I'll be coming for ya
(Coming for you)
Coming for ya (Coming for you)
For ya
For ya (Oh she loves it when I come)
For ya
Ooh I should be runnin'
Ooh you keep me coming for ya^
